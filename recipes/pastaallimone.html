    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Lemon pasta</strong> (<em>pasta al limone</em> in Italian) is more than the sum of its parts. It is luscious and amply cheesy, but bright thanks to fresh lemon juice and zest. Like in cacio e pepe and fettuccine Alfredo, the key to this weeknight dish is not an abundance of ingredients (there are only five) or in a long slow simmer (it takes just 15 minutes start to finish). Rather, this creamy lemon pasta recipe relies on the power of emulsion and your patience to execute it: Work one tablespoon of butter at a time into the cream, whisking until it melts and incorporates completely into the lemon sauce, before adding the next one.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1   lemon</li>
        <li>12  oz. spaghetti or other long pasta</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>6   Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3   oz. finely grated Parmesan (about 3/4 cup) </li>
        <li><em>Kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>Using a vegetable peeler, remove two 2"-long strips of lemon zest. Thinly slice each strip lengthwise into thin strands; set aside for serving. Finely grate remaining zest into a large pot (like a Dutch oven). Cut lemon in half and squeeze out enough juice to yield 2 Tbsp. into a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>Cook pasta in another large pot of boiling heavily salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (pasta will finish cooking in the sauce).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Meanwhile, add cream to pot with lemon zest and cook over medium heat, whisking often, until liquid is just beginning to simmer, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Whisk in butter 1 Tbsp. at a time until melted and sauce is creamy and emulsified. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>Just before pasta is al dente, scoop out 1½ cups pasta cooking liquid. Add ¾ cup pasta cooking liquid to cream sauce and return to medium heat. Using tongs, transfer spaghetti to pot with sauce (it's okay if a little water comes along with it). Cook, tossing often and adding Parmesan little by little, until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, about 3 minutes. If sauce looks tight, add 1–2 Tbsp. pasta cooking liquid. (Cream sauces tighten up very quickly as they cool, so it's better to lean on the saucier side of things.) Stir in reserved lemon juice; season with more salt, if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong>Divide pasta among bowls. Season with pepper, then top with reserved lemon zest strips.</li>
    </ol>
